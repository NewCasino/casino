Two slot games are developed with the following rules:

Business Rules
---------------
The first game (“slotgame”) should have the following rules:

The player has an infinite amount of coins.
The player bets 10 coins to play a normal game round
In any round (free or normal), the player has a 30 % chance of winning back 20 coins. 
In any round (free or normal), the player also has a 10% chance of triggering a free round where the player does not have to pay for bet. The free round works in the same way as a normal round except it costs 0 coins. The free round should follow immediately after the normal round.
The player can both win coins and free round at the same time. 

The second game (“bonusgame”) should have the following rules:

The player has an infinite amount of coins.
The player bets 10 coins to play a normal game
The player has a 10% chance of triggering a bonus game.
If the player wins a bonus game, they play a separate “box picking level”. In this round the player is given 5 boxes. One box will end the bonus game. The remaining boxes contain 5 coins each. Values are assigned to boxes randomly each time the player starts the level. The player will open boxes until they end the bonus level.
The player should not be able to win coins by any other means.
